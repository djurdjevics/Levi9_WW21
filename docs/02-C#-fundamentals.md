#Introduction

C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java.
Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work productively in C# within a very short time. 
C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, 
lambda expressions and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance,
and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code. 

As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, 
the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. 
Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition.
